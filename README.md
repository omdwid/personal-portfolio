## About The App

This is an app that showcases my project and skills as a developer

## Screenshots

## Technologies

I used `React`, `scss`, `Vite`, `Framer Motion`

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

## Approach

I adopted the `scss` for style because of benefits like nested syntax and convenience
